title: AMP- Accelerated Mobile Pages
---
##**What is AMP ?**

AMP is an open-source library that provides a straightforward way to create web pages that are compelling, smooth, and load near instantaneously for users. AMP pages are just web pages that you can link to and are controlled by you.

AMP builds on your existing skill sets and frameworks to create web pages. AMP is supported by many different platforms, and it's compatible across browsers.

AMP's ecosystem includes 25 million domains, 100+ technology providers, and leading platforms, that span the areas of publishing, advertising, e-commerce, local and small businesses, and more!

**##How AMP Works**
The following optimizations combined are the reason AMP pages are so fast they appear to load instantly:

1. Execute all AMP JavaScript asynchronously
2. Size all resources statically
3. Donâ€™t let extension mechanisms block rendering
4. Keep all third-party JavaScript out of the critical path
5. All CSS must be inline and size-bound
6. Font triggering must be efficient
7. Minimize style recalculations
8. Prioritize resource loading
